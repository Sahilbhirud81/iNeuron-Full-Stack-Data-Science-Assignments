    "\n",
    "- __ iter__returns the iterator object and is called at the start of loop in our respective class.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "-  __ next__ is called at each loop increment, it returns the incremented value. Also Stopiteration is raised when there is no value to return."

    "Ans:** __ str__ and __ repr__ are two operator overloading methods that manage printing.\n",

    "In Short, the difference between both these operators is the goal of __ repr__ is to be unambiguous and __ str__ is to be readable.\n",
    "Whenever we are printing any object reference internally __ str__ method will be called by default.\n",
    "The main purpose of __ str__ is for readability. it prints the informal string representation of an object, one that is useful for printing the object. it may not be possible to convert result string to original object.\n",
    "__ repr__ is used to print official string representation of an object, so it includes all information and development."
